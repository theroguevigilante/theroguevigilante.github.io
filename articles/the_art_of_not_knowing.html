        Imagine this you are learning something new like fixing your car, how to cook, switching from GNU/Linux to BSDs and suddenly in a moment of retrospect you see that you are doing well, and a thought crosses your mind, "Would you ever be able to learn all that <em>*this</em> has to offer?", in most general cases you come to the conclusion almost readily that "you won't know it all" and it's fine, because you just wanted to fix your car or you were learning how to cook this new dish, its not like you want to hyperspecialize in it and become something like a mechanic or a chef, and weirdly enough those field have their own hyper-hyperspeicalizations such as a mechanic might be good at fixing cars or motorcylces or a chef can be really good at cooking seafood or maybe he/she is good at cooking some other niche type of dishes.

        The point is modern day and age is filled with people who often <strong>hyper^(n)-specialize</strong> (treat n as a variable which depends on how <em>balls</em> deep you are into something) and sometimes I think that maybe this day and age requires individuals to be hyper^(n)-specialized due to the amount of complexity a general piece of modern techonology has, a basic device of the modern age such as a smartphone or a laptop requires a whole team of engineeres, designers to produce and that is when things like marketing and prodcut mangement is out of the equation and surely enough the modern man is better apt at communicating with other hyper^(n)-specialized individuals.

        When you look at it through a different perspective you see how this affects something, something known as a <strong>"POLYGOT"</strong>, a polygot is an individual who knows just enough about a lot of things generally speaking, but there is a better way to phrase this, a hyper^(n)-specialized individual might know the amount of things that he doesn't know in his own field, but a polygot generally has a better map of things that he doesn't knows in multiple fields and this is something which I call <strong>"THE ART OF NOT KNOWING"</strong>, the very thought of knowing the amount of things that you don't know feels very liberating, in a sense it shows you how insignificant you are in the grand scheme of Knowledge both quantity as well as quality wise, some might look at this and say, "But wouldn't it feel <em>suffocating</em>", I am not sure it might be suffocating, but to me this carries immense relief and at times I feel like the closer I come to knowing the things that I don't know brings me closer to <br>the <strong>universe</strong> as a whole.
