        <p class="content">So as you can already infer from the weblog entry title, "hello world" the canonical entry of a novice or
        even geeks/nerds (I know they are slightly different) into new programming languages or domains, this log
        serves as my entry point the "CANON EVENT" so to speak for all us "ZOOMERS" out there to the day I started
        logging my stuff and my programs on the internet, for now I am going to keep this only as a strict HTML/CSS
        and maybe JS who knows if I would need it, anyways so this is going to be a strict client side content.
        You can think of it like a journal, or specifically future me, yes I am talking to you bro look at those two,
        "oo"'s in "look" not here the one in the previous "look", and remember that we have to be consistent with this.</p>
        
        <p class="content">Also, maybe just maybe, I will add some api's here and there which would contact some server X somewhere
        for the purpose of learning and testing new stuff. Also I basically am a "noob coder", idk how far into the future,
        I would be able to carry this.</p>
        
        <p class="content">So, last thing what is going to happen to this in the near future, expect some api's I don't have an idea
        what I am going to be using, idk if I am good enough to code barebones api's in C, I have made some beginners api's in node
        and python but they are kind of a nothingburger.</p>

        <p class="content">OKAY, I should now get some crocodile tears in my eyes, *drum rolls*, I am ending this with a heavy heart
        Lets, see what the future holds, come on get out of here, you can see I am very bad at writing.</p>
